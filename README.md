## Description

In this challege, I built a full-stack crowdfunding app using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, Handlebars.js, and MVC architecture.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [User Stories](#user)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to see a list of current projects seeking funding.

* As a user, I want to be able to create an account.

* As a registered user, I want to post my own projects to ask for funding.

## Installation

* Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)

* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
